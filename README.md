# COMP-4990-Unity
To install the project, import the project files from Github into Unity (or create a new project with our files). 

To run our project: 

Access the scene: /Assets/Scenes/Demo Scene.unity.  

Place the vehicle somewhere on the track with walls if it is not already placed. 

Change up the settings of the vehicle to your liking (increasing speed of the simulation is recommended) 

Press play! 

The vehicle will now attempt to complete the track on its own. If it collides with an object such as sidewalk, it will be reset to its starting position. The vehicle will try to avoid any previous collisions. 

Note: Stopping the simulation will cause the neural network to be reset. Pausing is fine.
